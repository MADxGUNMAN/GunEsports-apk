# Uptodown Publishing Guide & Rejection Reasons

This guide explains why your APK might have been rejected by Uptodown and provides a step-by-step walkthrough for successfully publishing your app.

## 🚫 Common Reasons for Rejection

If your app was rejected, it likely falls into one of these categories. Check your app against this list:

### 1. Technical & Functional Issues
*   **Crashes & Bugs:** The app crashes, freezes, or doesn't work as intended during testing.
*   **Low Utility:** The app doesn't have a clear function or is just a "Hello World" test.
*   **Webviews/Templates:** Simple web wrappers (displaying a website) or unmodified app templates are often rejected.
*   **Broken Links:** If your app relies on external servers that are down or unreachable.

### 2. Content & Policy Violations
*   **Copyright Infringement:** Using assets (images, music, names) you don't own. **This is a very common reason.**
*   **Malware/Phishing:** Any sign of malicious code or data theft attempts.
*   **Impersonation:** Using icons or names that look too similar to popular existing apps (e.g., "Faceboook" or a blue 'f' icon).
*   **Inappropriate Content:** Explicit violence, hate speech, or adult content without proper flagging/rating.
*   **Scams/Spam:** Apps designed to trick users or purely for ad revenue without value.

### 3. Metadata Quality
*   **Bad Screenshots:** Blurry, stretched, or irrelevant screenshots.
*   **Poor Description:** A description that is too short, misleading, or full of keywords (keyword stuffing).
*   **Invalid Icon:** The icon is low resolution or not square.
